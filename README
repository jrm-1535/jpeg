#jpeg

A small jpeg library analysing jpeg files (JFIF)

The libary provides functions to analyse and display JPEG markers and tables
found in the input file. It checks the validity of those tables and scans and
allow fixing some common small errors (incorrect number of lines, duplicate or
useless markers). It is mostly useful to understand what might be wrong with a
jpeg file.
